<p style="font-family:Georgia">
Everyone loves a winner, that is until all they do is win. Max Veratappens recent dominance with Red Bull has made some race weekends feel more like follow-the-leader. However in the recent races, the Dutch and Italian Grand Prixs, we’ve seen some interesting threats to this dominance. This strategy was out in full force during the Singapore GP although some Red Bull technical and strategic issues meant they weren’t close enough to call it a point of difference. While Singapore marked an end to Verstappen's historic run it would be foolish to assume it meant an end to Red Bull dominance. It’s natural as seasons go on for the rest of the grid to catch up to the front runner but a new more defensive style of driving could be the answer to expediting this catch up.

</p>
	
<p style="font-family:Georgia">
The art of defending in Formula One is an often overlooked aspect of the sport but it gives some of the most exciting battles. The current best defenders on the grid seem to be Alex Albon and when given the space Carlos Sainz. In Monza both drivers had their skills on full display with Albon defending his lower position against the faster McLaren cars. Sainz was the real star of Monza as he held off Verstappen for 18 laps, the longest of any driver this season.  There were some close calls where it seemed Verstappen would overtake but some strategic breaking by Sainz kept him at bay. This came after a close battle between Verstappen and Alonso at Zandvoort. Defending has always been the best way for objectively slower cars to keep higher positions and works as a point of difference between drivers. Unlike most other aspects of F1 defending is almost entirely the driver.

</p>
	
<p style="font-family:Georgia">
Max Verstappen's unique driving style makes him extremely difficult to pass in corners but it’s also heavily susceptible to a good defense. His style relies on an oversteer in the corners putting him just barely off the race line on the inside. If the car in front of him breaks late on the corners he’s left in a position where he has to take the outside which doesn’t work as well with his driving style or with the back heavy RB19. We saw this struggle in Monza against Sainz who would routinely break later on corners, cutting off Verstappen and reducing his speed. Sainz’s masterful defending was on full display in Singapore where he led every lap even keeping his position under immense pressure in the final laps.
</p>
 
<p style="font-family:Georgia">
While Singapore saw RedBull below the podium, the same trend is unlikely to continue in Japan. The Singapore track and climate are the RB19’s achilles heel but the same cannot be said for Japan. Japan with its long DRS straight and its winding corners lend itself quite well not only to the car but also to Verstappen's strengths. This was evident by his almost 20 second lead to the Norris behind. While no one else was quite ready to grab and hold the lead the race still gave some insight on developing strategies. Undertaking in the pits seemed to be the move of choices. While this worked for many teams it created some sour moments between teammates. Japan is a circuit known to be harder on tires which explains why pit stops were such a huge part of the race. One of the interesting things we saw with Japan is an evolution of defending strategies. Mercedes weakly attempted to replicate Sainz’s Singapore move and while this failed for a variety of factors it helps to show a shift starting in how teams run. The truth is no car on the grid is beating RedBull on speed alone but looking at the drivers who have been at least competitive we saw a brewing strategy.
</p>

<p style="font-family:Georgia">
The non red bull drivers we’re seeing succeed this season like Sainz and Alonso all have a special knack for defending which has given them a much needed leg up in the season. Verstappen hasn’t had to do much defending due to the sheer speed dominance of his team meaning he’s less familiar with the tactics. It’s nearly impossible for one driver to lead an entire race; things like pit stops are a necessary part of any race. Teams can use this to undertake the faster Red Bulls and focus instead on defending. The key to this strategy is to pit earlier to ensure a solid foundation for defending. It works best when two drivers, typically team mates, come together to create a wider gap for a pit stop and close gaps across the grid so they can easily move back to position. This undertaking strategy puts drivers in a position we’ve seen frequently this season, on a podium with a Red Bull hot on their tail. This is where being well versed in defending becomes the point of difference. Breaking late and being willing to reposition on the race line are crucial steps that can lead to a much more even playing field.
</p>

<p style="font-family:Georgia">
Formula 1 will never be a fair fight but in the absence of equal equipment strategy becomes a saving grace. The skill of a driver will always show in the end, there’s no reason to sit by and wait for the end of dominance. Like all things in sports these tactics are easier said than done but seeing more teams implement a more defensive style stands to not only even the field but give viewers more exciting battles. In sports it’s adapt or die and it’s time to change before an era of dominance kills F1.
</p>

<p style="font-family:Georgia">
Outside of just Tottenham there’s been quite a few change ups in the premier league which have helped bring the club to the top. Notably Manchester City are on a recent losing streak after losing two games in a row for the first time in almost five years. Arsenal, last year's top competitors, found the early stages of the season quite a challenge but have now worked themselves up to a shaky second. The struggles faced by the other teams have opened the gateway for Tottenham’s strategy to really take center stage. The stars seem to have finally aligned in Spurs favor, the issue about stars however is they forever change.
